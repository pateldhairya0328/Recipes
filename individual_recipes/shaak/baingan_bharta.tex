\section*{Ingredients}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 large eggplant, cut into thin slices lengthwise.
    \item 1/2 large onion, diced.
    \item 1 large tomato, diced.
    \item 3 gloves of garlic, minced.
    \item Oil.
    \item લાલ મરચું.
    \item હળદર.
    \item Salt.

\section*{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set instant pot to sauté at normal heat, and add a little bit of oil.
    \item When instant pot shows hot, cover bottom of bot with 1 layer of eggplant slices. Wait until the slices are charred (it is okay if it sticks to the bottom of the bot, you can scrape it off). When they char, add a little bit more oil and the next layer of eggplant slices, and move the already charred eggplant slices (they will have shrunk) to the side or on top of the new layer.
    \item When all the eggplant slices are charred, add the spices, salt, onion and garlic. Let it roast for a bit.
    \item Add the tomatoes and a 1/2 cup of water. Immediately close the instant pot and pressure cook on high for 3 minutes.
    \item Release the steam immediately after the pressure cooking is finished, and open the lid. Boil off extra water if needed by setting the instant pot to sauté.
\end{enumerate}
